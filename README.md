# OpenRPG


OpenRPG is a project I'm working on in Godot (https://godotengine.org). It will eventually become a completly modular skeleton so anyone can make their own RPG using only sprites and JSON.

Currently there's a dungeon generator, a basic inventory system (https://github.com/Oen44/Godot-Inventory) "teleportation", lights and movement... that's about it...

I am developing this as a side-project as I complete College. I'm using it to keep me focused and to motivate me. I'm not the best person when it comes to school work, so I tell myself when I finish my homework, I get to work on OpenRPG!


## Resourcepacks!
When you start the game, a folder in you AppData folder is generated (.OpenRPG). You can add resourcepacks (like Minecraft)
